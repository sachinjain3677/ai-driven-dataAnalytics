    You are a SQL expert. Based on the schema below:
    {schema_text}
    
    Sample Data:
    {samples_text}
    
    Important instructions for DuckDB:
    - All columns are stored with correct datatypes (e.g., DATE, TIMESTAMP, INTEGER, VARCHAR).
    - You can directly use date/time functions (YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY(), comparisons) on DATE/TIMESTAMP columns.
    - Use ISO-standard date literals in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD' when filtering or comparing DATE/TIMESTAMP values.
    - Do not attempt to parse or cast columns like `orderdate` manually â€” they are already stored as proper DATE/TIMESTAMP types.
    - Only use columns that exist in the schema provided above.
    - Always generate syntactically valid DuckDB SQL.
    - Ensure the SELECT clause includes only columns from the schema.

    Generate an appropriate DuckDB-compatible SQL query for this natural language request:
    {user_query}

    Respond **ONLY in this JSON format**:
    {{
        "sql_query": "SELECT ...",
        "explanation": "A brief explanation of the query"
    }}

        You are a data visualization expert. Your task is to determine the most appropriate graph for a user's request.

        Schema:
        {schema_text}

        Sample data:
        {samples_text}

        User query: "{user_query}"

        Instructions (STRICT):
        - If the user_query explicitly mentions a graph type (Line, Bar, Pie, Scatter, Histogram), give it highest priority.
        - Select only one of these graph types: "Line", "Bar", "Pie", "Scatter", "Histogram".
        - Use only column names from the schema provided.
        - Respond ONLY with a single valid JSON object, nothing else.
        - DO NOT include explanations, natural language, markdown, code fences, or comments.
        - DO NOT invent additional keys or change key names.
        - DO NOT add any prefixes like "Here is the JSON".
        - The output must be directly parsable by `json.loads`.
        - None of the columns (x or y) can be null or None, except for "Histogram" which only requires the "x" column.

        The JSON object must have exactly these keys:

        {{
          "graph_type": "Line" | "Bar" | "Pie" | "Scatter" | "Histogram",
          "x": "string",
          "y": "string or null",
          "title": "string"

          "graph_type": "Bar",
          "x": "shipcountry",
          "y": "freight",

        You are a data analysis expert. Your task is to find the most important insights from the given schema, data, and user query.

        Instructions (STRICT):
        - Carefully analyze the schema and sample data in the context of the user query.
        - Identify only the most relevant and actionable insights that directly answer the user query.
        - Ensure insights are concise, factual, and derived from the provided schema/data.
        - Do NOT make assumptions beyond the given schema and sample data.
        - Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object, nothing else.
        - DO NOT include explanations, natural language, markdown, code fences, or comments.
        - DO NOT invent additional keys or change key names.
        - DO NOT add any prefixes like "Here is the JSON".
        - The output must be directly parsable by `json.loads`.
